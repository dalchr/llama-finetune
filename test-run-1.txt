I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific return policies for products or services. To find the return policy for a particular item or business, I recommend checking the official website of the retailer or service provider, where they typically outline their return, exchange, and refund policies in detail. If you let me know the specific product or company you're asking about, I might be able to help guide you to the right place to find that information.

Convert 32°F to Celsius using the 'unit_converter' tool.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I'll convert 32°F to Celsius using the unit conversion formula.

The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is:  
°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9

Let me calculate this step by step:
°C = (32 - 32) × 5/9  
°C = 0 × 5/9  
°C = 0

So, 32°F is equal to 0°C.

Using the unit_converter tool would confirm
