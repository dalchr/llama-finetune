What strategies in relation to hardware or solution approach would increase performance and/or reduce the run times?
ChatGPT said:

Great question ‚Äî this is where hardware setup and training approach really matter. For fine-tuning a 7B model with LoRA/QLoRA, you can squeeze a lot more throughput out of your system. I‚Äôll break it into hardware strategies and solution-level strategies.

üîß Hardware strategies

GPU VRAM capacity > raw FLOPs

A 5090 already has high FLOPs, but the bottleneck is often memory.

More VRAM lets you increase effective batch size (tokens processed per step) ‚Üí fewer gradient accumulation steps ‚Üí higher throughput.

Multi-GPU (if available)

Use accelerate, DeepSpeed, or FSDP for distributed training across multiple GPUs.

With 2√ó5090s you can nearly halve wall-time, as long as you keep sequences/batches balanced.

Fast storage (NVMe SSD)

Tokenized datasets can be large. Using NVMe avoids dataloader stalls.

Put the dataset and HF cache on NVMe instead of HDD/SATA SSD.

CPU & RAM tuning

Your 7950X3D + 96 GB is plenty, but set num_workers in your DataLoader (multiprocessing) to keep the GPU fed.

Use pinned memory (pin_memory=True) so CPU‚ÜíGPU transfers don‚Äôt stall.

üí° Solution-level strategies

LoRA/QLoRA vs. Full fine-tune

LoRA already cuts compute dramatically.

QLoRA (4-bit quantized base model + LoRA adapters) reduces memory use further, allowing bigger batch sizes and faster training at nearly the same quality.

Reduce sequence length

Throughput is quadratic in context length.

If your task doesn‚Äôt need 512 tokens, dropping to 256 can nearly double training speed.

Conversely, unnecessarily long sequences burn GPU time.

Gradient checkpointing (selectively)

Saves VRAM but slows compute.

On a big VRAM GPU like the 5090, you can often turn it off for faster training.

Mixed precision (bf16/fp16)

Already default in that repo. Ensures tensor cores are used at full speed.

Increase batch size with gradient accumulation tuning

Bigger effective batch size ‚Üí fewer optimizer steps per epoch ‚Üí lower overhead.

Find the sweet spot where VRAM is fully used but not swapping.

Optimizer choice

Adafactor can be faster and lighter than AdamW for large models, though sometimes at slight quality trade-off.

If you stick with AdamW, ensure fused kernels are enabled (e.g. via PyTorch‚Äôs fused AdamW).

Distributed strategy libraries

DeepSpeed Zero-2/Zero-3 or PyTorch FSDP can shard optimizer states ‚Üí better scaling if you expand to multiple GPUs.

Even on one GPU, ZeRO-2 can cut memory overhead, letting you push larger batches.

Dataset size management

If runtime is too long, consider curriculum or staged fine-tuning:

Train first on a subset, then continue on the full set.

Or limit to fewer epochs ‚Äî LoRA often converges quickly.

‚úÖ Practical steps for your 5090 setup (single-GPU, 32 GB VRAM assumed):

Switch to QLoRA for larger batches.

Try seq_len=256 unless your data truly needs 512+.

Turn off gradient checkpointing unless VRAM forces you.

Use num_workers ‚âà 8‚Äì16 in your dataloader, with NVMe storage.

Monitor GPU utilization with nvidia-smi dmon ‚Äî aim for >90%.

Would you like me to sketch an optimized training config (batch size, precision, seq_len, optimizer) that would likely cut your wall-time in half on the 5090, compared to the repo defaults?

Thought for 16s

Nice ‚Äî good choice to benchmark. I‚Äôll keep it concrete: first I show the key hardware facts (memory, memory bandwidth, tensor FLOPS) from vendor/review sources, then translate those into practical throughput / runtime effects for a LoRA/QLoRA SFT of a 7B model (the same formula we used earlier). I‚Äôll state assumptions and give conservative ranges rather than pretending we can measure exact tokens/sec without running the job.

Quick spec highlights (important for LLM training)

How to think about practical throughput for LoRA/QLoRA

Real-world fine-tuning throughput depends on multiple factors, but two hardware factors dominate:

Tensor FLOPS at the precision you use (fp16/bf16/ft8) ‚Äî determines raw compute speed for matmuls.

Memory capacity & bandwidth ‚Äî determines maximum batch size and how fast weights/activations can be streamed; large models and big batches favor more VRAM and higher bandwidth.

For LoRA/QLoRA on a 7B model, memory capacity controls the effective batch size (thus steps/sec) and tensor FLOPS + memory bandwidth control tokens/sec. In practice, token/s scales roughly with the card‚Äôs effective tensor throughput and how large a batch you can fit.

Conservative comparative rule-of-thumb multipliers

(These are conservative, practical multipliers you can use to scale an estimated tokens/sec measured or assumed on one card to another card.)

RTX 5090 = baseline (what we used in previous answers). Real 7B LoRA throughput estimate used earlier: ~1.5k‚Äì5k tokens/sec (depends on seq_len, batch, dataset pipeline).

RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB / Blackwell workstation)

Memory advantage: 96 GB vs 32 GB on 5090 lets you run much larger effective batch sizes (fewer grad-accum steps), and fit bigger seq_len or larger per-step batches. That reduces optimizer/overhead cost and increases tokens/sec.

Compute: raw tensor TFLOPS are competitive to the 5090 (same Blackwell architecture), sometimes lower or similar for FP32 but the PRO has larger L2/cache and ECC, and very large memory bandwidth on some PRO SKUs.

Practical multiplier: ~1.0‚Äì1.6√ó tokens/sec vs 5090 ‚Äî i.e., modest to substantial speedup because you can increase effective batch size and avoid gradient accumulation overhead. (If you need bigger sequences / bigger batches that wouldn‚Äôt fit on 5090, the PRO‚Äôs advantage can be near the top of this range).
NVIDIA

NVIDIA H100 (PCIe / SXM)

Compute advantage: H100‚Äôs tensor TFLOPS for FP16/BF16 are substantially higher (PCIe: ~1,500 TFLOPS FP16 tensor figure; SXM: ~1,900 TFLOPS ‚Äî see datasheet). Memory bandwidth is orders of magnitude higher (TB/s vs GB/s). This translates to much higher matmul throughput and higher tokens/sec.

Practical multiplier: ~3‚Äì6√ó tokens/sec vs RTX 5090 depending on variant (PCIe vs SXM), drivers, library optimizations (TensorRT/CuBLAS/MEGATRON/DeepSpeed), and whether you exploit the H100 Transformer Engine / FP8. For many transformer training workloads H100 gives ~3√ó real-world speedups relative to top consumer cards ‚Äî sometimes more when using advanced precisions.

Translate that to wall-time for the repo defaults (example)

Recall the repo-default scenario we previously used: seq_len=512, epochs=3. Baseline 5090 estimated tokens/sec = 1.5k‚Äì5k (range). Let‚Äôs compare:

Case: 10k examples ‚Üí 15.36M tokens (512 √ó 10k √ó 3)

RTX 5090 ‚Äî 1.5k‚Äì5k tok/s ‚Üí ‚âà 0.9‚Äì2.8 hours. (Note: earlier I gave 3‚Äì13 hours for a different baseline range ‚Äî here we‚Äôre using the more optimistic 1.5k‚Äì5k; pick the earlier wide-range if you expect I/O or dataloader inefficiencies.)
Tom's Hardware

RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB) ‚Äî 1.0‚Äì1.6√ó ‚Üí ‚âà 0.9‚Äì4.5 hours (practically similar lower bound, upper bound faster due to larger batch) depending on how much batch you enlarge.
NVIDIA

H100 ‚Äî 3‚Äì6√ó ‚Üí ‚âà 0.15‚Äì0.93 hours (9‚Äì56 minutes).
DataCrunch

Case: 50k examples ‚Üí 76.8M tokens

RTX 5090 ‚Üí ‚âà 4.3‚Äì14.2 hours.

RTX PRO 6000 ‚Üí ‚âà 4.3‚Äì22.8 hours (depends on how you leverage the extra VRAM ‚Äî could be faster if you can meaningfully increase batch size).

H100 ‚Üí ‚âà 0.7‚Äì4.3 hours.

Key takeaway: H100 massively lowers wall-time (multi-hour job ‚Üí under an hour in many cases). RTX PRO 6000‚Äôs main practical win is ability to run larger batches / longer contexts and better stability (ECC, pro drivers) ‚Äî which often yields a measurable speedup vs a consumer 5090, but not orders of magnitude.

Important: these are estimates, not measured benchmarks. Real throughput depends on software stack (PyTorch + cuBLAS/cuDNN + DeepSpeed/FSDP/accelerate), precision used (bf16, fp16, fp8/TF32), dataloader efficiency, and whether you use QLoRA (4-bit) or LoRA.

Practical recommendations for maximizing speed given these cards

If you have access to H100 (best if SXM variant): use it for the heavy / large dataset runs. Use BF16/FP16 or FP8 where supported, and use DeepSpeed (ZeRO) and NVLink/SXM interconnect if multi-GPU ‚Äî you‚Äôll get the largest single-card and multi-card speedups.
Megware

If you own / can buy an RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB):

Use it for larger context lengths or larger batch training that can‚Äôt fit on 32 GB 5090. Big VRAM is sometimes even more important than raw peak TFLOPS because it enables higher effective batches.

Use enterprise drivers and enable ECC for stability on long runs.
NVIDIA

If you only have RTX 5090: tune for throughput: QLoRA + LoRA, reduce seq_len if feasible, maximize num_workers + pinned memory, and use bf16/fp16. You‚Äôll still get very decent runtimes for 7B LoRA runs.
Tom's Hardware

Software & distribution: using DeepSpeed + ZeRO or FSDP can change the picture dramatically if you scale to multiple cards (and can often beat single H100 by linear scaling). Use optimized kernels (NVIDIA/apex/fused optimizers) to reduce overhead.

Which card is the better buy for you?

If budget is not the main constraint and you train many / large LLM jobs: H100 (or renting equivalents on cloud) gives the best speed per job and lets you iterate faster.

If you want a long-lived workstation that can handle large single-node jobs and also be used for professional workloads: RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB) is attractive ‚Äî it trades some peak raw TFLOPS for huge VRAM and stability (ECC), and removes the need for gradient accumulation in many scenarios.

If you want the best consumer price/perf & occasional fine-tuning: RTX 5090 is extremely capable and most workloads for 7B LoRA will complete fine on it.

Want a tailored table / numeric comparison?

I can produce a compact table that lists:

spec lines (VRAM, mem BW, FP16 Tensor TFLOPS),

a tokens/sec estimate band for each card (based on your measured 5090 or my conservative baseline), and

estimated runtime examples for your dataset sizes (10k / 50k / 100k examples).

Tell me which baseline tokens/sec you‚Äôd like me to use for RTX 5090 (my conservative range: 1.5k‚Äì5k tok/s) or paste a measured tokens/sec if you have one, and I‚Äôll generate the table and runtime estimates (and include the cited sources).

### Estimated Runtimes (Repo Defaults: seq_len=512, epochs=3)

- **Token count per example**: `512 tokens √ó 3 epochs = 1,536 tokens`
- **Total examples = 10 k ‚Üí ~15.4M tokens**
- **Estimated runtimes:**
  - **RTX 5090**: ~0.9‚Äì2.8 hours (1.5‚Äì5k tok/s)

*(Times scale linearly. At 50 k examples ‚Üí multiply by 5; at 100 k ‚Üí √ó10)*

## Optimization Strategies to Increase Throughput

- **Use QLoRA (4-bit quantization)**: Reduces memory footprint and boosts tokens/sec significantly.
- **Adjust `seq_len`**: Cutting from 512 ‚Üí 256 can nearly double throughput, if task allows.
- **Maximize batch size or effective batch via gradient accumulation**: Larger batches reduce per-step overhead.
- **Leverage multi-GPU with DeepSpeed (ZeRO) or FSDP**: Greatly improves scaling and reduces optimizer memory.
- **Disable gradient checkpointing** when VRAM allows ‚Äî speeds up compute.
- **Enable pinned memory and sufficient dataloader workers** (`num_workers`, `pin_memory=True`) to keep GPU fully utilized.
- **Use optimized/fused optimizers and kernels**, such as fused AdamW, FlashAttention, Triton kernels (e.g., via Unsloth) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- **Unsloth** offers reported **~2‚Äì5√ó faster fine-tuning** with 50‚Äì80% memory savings and no accuracy drop :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
- **Optimizer alternatives** like **BAdam** offer full fine-tuning with reduced memory/time compared to LoRA/AdamW :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

## Quick Recommendations

- **RTX 5090**: Great for typical LoRA/QLoRA jobs. Use QLoRA, shorter sequences, and optimize batch and dataloader.
- **RTX PRO-6000 (96 GB)**: Best if you need large sequences/batches; ECC stability helps long runs.
- **NVIDIA H100**: Ideal if you want fastest time-to-finish ‚Äî especially for large datasets ‚Äî and can leverage advanced quant and multi-GPU scaling.

> *Note:* All numbers are **estimates**. Real-world throughput depends on your hardware, drivers, model config, software stack, dataset, and code efficiency.
